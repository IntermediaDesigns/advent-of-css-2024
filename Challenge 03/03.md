## Requirements

* When you hover over the text, the tooltip should appear.
* When you roll off the text, the tooltip should disappear.
* *There are no additional project files today.* Everything, including the arrow should be created with CSS.

## Get Started

1. Happy coding!
2. Once you've finished, share your work using #adventofcss

## FAQs

* **Can I use libraries / frameworks like TailwindCSS on these projects?** Of course! This is also a good opportunity to challenge yourself and experiment with something new.
* **Oh no! I'm stuck!** Comment on this challenge within Podia. As a community, let's help each other out.
* **Can I use this project in my portfolio?** Sure! But, be honest about the work that you did.

Merry Coding,
Amy
