# Photo Gallery Card Challenge

Welcome to Day 1 of the Advent of CSS! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

For today's challenge, we'll build a photo gallery card component similar to Facebook's feed implementation. The key challenge is creating a "smart" grid system that can handle different numbers of photos elegantly, from a single photo up to 21+ images.
